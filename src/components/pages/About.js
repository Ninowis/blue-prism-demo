      <p className="lead-text"><strong>Disclaimer notice: this is <em>not</em> the recommended approach for single app projects.</strong></p>
      <p className="lead-text">
        This application structure breaks from recommended React practices and is the result of personal and maybe opinionated choices and practices in terms of systems architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is mostly tuned to my current practices while working with pattern-libraries and as such, should not be considered it so much as a point of reference but merely as a starter kit yet to be adapted to specific workflow and projects.
      </p>
      <h3>Working with pattern libraries</h3>
      <p>
        Coming from a <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" title="visit Gulp.js website">Gulp</a> workflow, I've always used an external Sass structure for the styling of my projects, mostly relying on the <a href="https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern" title="the 7-1 pattern on Sass guidelines">7-1 Pattern</a> and Jonathan Snook's <a href="https://smacss.com/" title="about SMACSS by Jonathan Snook">SMACSS</a> approach for engineering a versatile yet optimized pattern-library for complex applications.<br/>
        With the growing trends of system architectures being based on micro-services, pattern-libraries have taken some serious new turns since SMACSS, but even though most of us have nowadays adopted <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/" title="Atomic Design Methodolgy by Brad Frost">Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodoly</a>, its actual implementation across multiple applications and a varied range of technologies often still rely on such independent stylesheets libraries.
      </p>
      <h3>Moving forward</h3>
      <p>
        Webpack has some very interesting tools and features to facilitate the transition towards fully independent components in frameworks like Vue or React (<a href="https://www.styled-components.com/" title="visit project website">Styled Components</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/" title="What are CSS Modules and why do we need them? on CSS tricks">CSS modules</a>).<br/>
        As much as I look forward to adopt them, this project is <strong>not</strong> an attempt at exploring them, but the voluntary intention to develop a React boilerplate compatible with an external and technology-agnostic pattern-library approach currently in use amongst other projects I am working on.<br/>
